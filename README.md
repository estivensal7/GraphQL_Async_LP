# GraphQL_Async_LP

### Overview

Throughout the Full Stack Web Development course we learned how to build, and work with REST APIs. In the following activities, and presentations you will learn about GraphQL! By the end of this short course you will understand the differences between the REST APIs that we have built, and the features that GraphQL has to offer. Since the best way to learn is to build, we will build a small application using React, Apollo, MongoDB, Express, and GraphQL.

##### What is GraphQL?

GraphQL, introduced by Facebook is a query language for APIs that provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API. It gives you the power to ask for exactly what you need from your API and nothing more. It is usually described as a frontend-directed API technology as it allows front-end developers to request data in a much simpler way than ever before. The best part is the language isn't dependent on any specific database management system.
